            <p>Let me introduce myself.</p>
            <p>My name is Amarjit Datta. I am an experienced computer professional working in software industry for almost last 7 years. Right now, I am working in Vizrt, a leading content production software tool producer company in the digital media industry.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Dhaka, big busy metropoliton city of Bangladesh. My school was Government Laboratory High School and my college was Notre Dame College. After that, I studied in computer science and engineering from BUET (Bangladesh University of Englineering and Technology). I've finished my graduation on year 2009. But even before I was graduated, I got engaged with software development and real life problem solving issues.</p>
            <p>I started my career in RnD. Initially worked on mobile application development team in a South Africa based outsourcing company. After working there for sometime and also trying out different opportunities in some other companies, I joined Vizrt in year 2010. From 2010 to 2014, I worked in Vizrt both in Dhaka and Thailand office. On April, 2014, I moved back in Bangladesh and started working in a Noreign based software company Cefalo. Since then, I am working for Cefalo.</p>
            <p>My parents live in Bangladesh. I have one elder brother. He lives in Ireland along with his wife and his daughter. I am very closing bonded with my family. We all try to visit each other at least once every year.</p>
            <p>Apart from work and geeky stuffs, I have some nice hobbies to share. I love playing Cricket and chatting with friends. I like trying out new foods and traveling places with my fiends and colleagues. I have a plan to travel 100 countries before I die. So far, I guess I've managed only 7. Still long way to go.</p>
            <p>I don't believe I have any exceptional talent. Nor I have any gifted skills. I believe in hard work only. I think if we want to achive something and if we really work hard for it, use our mind and run in the right direction...we will succeed. I like maintaining good relationship with everyone. I want to treat everyone as my friend. Everytime I meet a new person, I try to learn good things from him.</p>
            <p>Thats all about me. Hope you'll like my page. If you have any query about me or want to know anything more specific, feel free to email me.</p>
